## NFL Score Tracker 
The idea behind this is built around a spreadsheet that my brother made for him and his friends to track how each of their football picks were doing compared to one another. 

Makes a call to ESPN's API to get this weeks scores, extracts the winners and then compares the winners to which player picked that team to win. In a match up between two players, whoever's team won, gets a W added to their column and the loser gets an L in their column.

The spreadsheet has a function that updates the players overall scores based on how many wins they have.
